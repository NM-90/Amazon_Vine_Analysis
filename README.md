# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
Big Data/Colab/SQL/Python

## Overview/Purpose

I will analyze Amazon reviews written by member of the paid Amazon Vine program.  Manufacturers and publishers pay a small fee to Amazon to sell their products and in return receive product reviews.  I will explore the pet product data set using Colab, PySpark, SQL (PGAdmin), Python, and AWS by performing ETL. The results should show whether there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members.    

## Results

There is a bulleted list that addresses the three questions for unpaid and paid program reviews (7 pt)

## Summary

The summary states whether or not there is bias, and the results support this statement (2 pt)
An additional analysis is recommended to support the statement (2 pt)
